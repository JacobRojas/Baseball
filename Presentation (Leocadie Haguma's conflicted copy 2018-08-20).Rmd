# History

- Trends of decreasing home runs followed by increasing home runs

![](Home_runs_since_1890s.png)


# History cont..

- More home runs brings in more fans 
- More fans brings in more money to the MLB
- Player philosophy as has changed many times in baseball. 
- Babe Ruth introduced the populatiry of the upswing [^2]


# Problem

## There is an in increasing trend of home runs between the 2015 to 2017 season. We plan to explore why and how this trend occurred. 

# Speculation

- What some have said

# Report of the Committee Studying Home Run Rates in Major League Baseball
The Scientists[^1]

- Jim Albert, Bowling Green State University  
- Jay Bartroff, University of Southern California  
- Roger Blandford, Stanford University    
- Dan Brooks, Researcher & co-organizer of Saberseminar  
- Josh Derenski, Statistics PhD student USC  
- Larry Goldstein, University of Southern California  
- Anette (Peko) Hosoi, Massachusets Institute of Technology  
- Gary Lorden, Caltech  
- Alan Nathan(chair), University of Illinois - Urbana-Champaign  
- Lloyd Smith, Washington State University  


# Their Conjectures about Home Runs

  - Concentration of home runs among a certain group of players
  
  - Concentration of home runs among certain balls park
  
  - Changes in Pitching Strategy
  
  - Changes in Batting Strategy 
  
  - Characteristics of Home Runs


# Launch angles and Exit Velocities
  
- The probability of hitting a ball into the "red zone" did not change.
- Red Zone: Velocities between (90 and 115)mph and Launch angles bwtween (15 and 45 degrees)
  
![](Commisoner_2016.png)


# Launch angles and Exit Velocities cont..

- BUT the probability of hitting a ball into the "red zone" AND making a home run DID change.
- This means that the drag coefficients of the ball changed
![](Commisioner_2017.png)


# Temperature or The Ball 

- Analysis on temperature concluded that home run surge could be explained by temperature. 

- The commited went to Rawlings in Costa Rica to analyze the manufacturing of the ball 

- Tests performed to measure properties of the baseball provided no proof of significant changes


# Official Committee Conclusions

## The ball bahaved differetly in the air, but the physical properties of the ball remained inside parameters set by the MLB


# Recommended changes:

  - Establish methods to measure properties of the ball that affect carry
  
  - Monitor the climate the balls are stored in
  
  - Re-evaluate specifications of the ball from Rawlings
  
  - Improve completeness of StatCast data


# Fivethirtyeight.com

Who?

- A data journalism blog created by Nate Silver who is an american statistician.
- Long history of predictive analytics successes in sports and politics.

# Fivethirtyeight.com cont..

What did they do?

- Used a Computed Tomography (CT) scan to X-ray baseballs 
- USed a Gravimetric testing for a Chemical Composition of the ball

# Fivethirtyeight.com cont..

What did they find?

- The chemicall composistion of the core of the baseball chaged
- The entire baseball was now 0.5g lighter

What they concluded?

- These changes to the ball could only account for 25% of the surge
- The surge was a 46% increase home runs

# Our Story

## We believe the most unexplored area of the surge is the players themselves.

# Difficulty in Collecting Data

  - Initial difficulty, MLB website not scrape-friendly
  - Some data unavailable Baseballr

# Data Collection

- Baseball Savant: Statcast measurements (pitch speed, exit velocity, etc.)
- Lahman: general player info (age, height, weight)


# Data Organization

# Players

Our investigation focused on how the players themselves were affecting the increase in home runs. We decided to look at the following variables for this:

- Age
- Height and weight 
- New MLB player (Rookies)

# Age

Is age a factor in the surge? Does the age of the individual players affect home run production?

![](homerun_ages.png)


# Height and Weight

We used height and weight of all players as a proxy for the strength. Are players getting stronger? I.e are they taller and/or weight more?

![](wh_with_pitchers.png)

# Heights and Weights cont..
![](wh_with_pitchers_1.png)


# Height and Weight cont..

We decided to eliminate pitchers from this database. Are the batters getting stronger?

![](h_wihout_pitchers.png)

# Heigths and Weights cont..

![](w_wihout_pitchers.png)

# New MLB Player (Rookies)
Is the incoming class of MLB hitters also affected by the surge in home runs?

![](rookies_wh_with_pitchers_1.png)


# New MLB Player (Rookies) cont..

Are the Rookies stronger?

![](rookies_wh_no_pitches.png)

# Pitchers 

Are pitchers throwing differntly?

![](total_pitchs_and_strikeouts.png)
# Pitchers cont..

Where are the stike outs and Home run happenning?

![](Stirkeouts.png)


# Regression 
Variables: 

- release speed	
- weight
- height		
- stand
- age
- throw
- Interaction of height and weight		
- Multiple regressions ran: Pre/post 2015, post 2015 with launch speed added

# Significance 
![](pre2015reg.png)

#Significance cont..
![](post2015reg.png)

#Significance cont..
![](post2015Exitvelo.png)


#Significance cont..

- Pre-2015 shows high significance of all variables, throwing arm less so
- Post-2015 shows high significance of all variables, except age
- Post-2015 with added speed no longer holds weight or height as significant

# Conclusion

- We looked at variables that describe the players and how they have changed. We found that the home run surge cannot be explained by the players changing.

# Future

- Access to more completeness of Data
- If we had more time, we could inspect the ball more
